## Terms of use

accessibility.cloud ("AC") is one of SOZIALHELDEN e.V. ("Operator", "we") is an online application operated by SOZIALHELDEN e.V. that enables users to provide and retrieve accessibility information from publicly accessible locations. The dissemination of data among users should make it possible to disseminate accessibility information as widely as possible.

The operator is a non-profit association based in Berlin. We operate the AC for charitable reasons and with no intention of making a profit. As the operator, we merely provide users with the AC with the technical infrastructure for data exchange between each other, without collecting data ourselves, validating it and offering it to users as their own content.

The following terms of use govern the use of AC between the user and the operator.

1. service description

	1. AC is available at the URL [https://www.accessibility.cloud](http://accessibility.cloud) (hereinafter the "Website") for the operating systems and browsers mentioned on the Website.

	2. via AC, the operator provides individual or aggregated data on accessibility of publicly accessible places via data packages ("data sources") from users for users. Users may provide data sources (as "Data Providers") and/or retrieve provided data sources (as "Data Users"). AC itself does not create any data or data sources.

	3. the operator does not charge any fees to other non-profit organisations for the use of AC.

	4. The Operator, as a non-profit association, cannot guarantee the permanent availability of the AC. The user is therefore not entitled to uninterrupted access to the AC. However, the operator makes every effort to ensure the highest possible availability of the AC. The Operator may restrict the operation of the AC at any time or terminate it 14 days after corresponding announcement. The user has and acquires no claim to continued use of the AC.

2. user accounts

	1. The use of the AC requires registration of the user on the website. By registering, the user agrees to these terms of use. In the course of registration, the user creates a user account by depositing his e-mail address and a password (collectively the "Registration Data"). The user must keep his password secret and carefully secure access to the user account.

	2. We collect and process the registration data in accordance with the data protection declaration for this website.

	3. The user may not transfer his account to third parties without the prior consent of the operator. If the Operator becomes aware of an account transfer to which he has not consented, he may terminate the user contract for this account without notice by e-mail to the deposited e-mail address and irretrievably delete the user account. We reserve the right to take further measures in accordance with Section 7 of these Terms of Use.

	4. The user may terminate his user account at any time by sending an e-mail to support@accessibility.cloud . In the event of termination, the user account and data belonging to the account will be irretrievably deleted by the Operator within three working days of receipt of the termination email.

3. provision of data sources

	1. the data published on the AC is provided by users of the Website in the form of data sources ("Data Providers"). A data provider may provide one or more data sources. The Data Provider may only provide data about publicly accessible locations (e.g., railway stations, restaurants, government agencies, shops). The data provider shall ensure that the data provided by him is accessible (e.g. wheelchair accessibility). The data provider affirms that it may grant rights of use to the data sources uploaded by it and may disseminate and make publicly accessible these and that the data contained therein have been lawfully collected, processed and transmitted to AC.

	2. The Data Provider shall provide data sources:

		1. the upload of a data source in a file format supported by AC (e.g. CSV or JSON); or

		2. the connection to an API; in this case AC is entitled to address queries to the API.


	3. The Data Provider shall specify which data users and which applications are authorized to use the respective data source when uploading each data source provided by him to AC or when connecting to the API. Alternatively, the data provider may authorize each user and/or application to use the respective data source. The Data Provider shall at all times have control over which users and applications may use the data sources provided by him; in particular, the Data Provider may delete or stop access to the data sources provided at any time. In the event of deletion by the data provider, data stored at AC from the respective data source will be deleted immediately, but for technical reasons may still be accessible via caches for a maximum of 30 days thereafter.

	4. data sources may be put into a draft mode before publication and shall then only be visible to members of the organisation to which the data source is assigned.

	  5. AC shall store the data provided, read them out technically (automatically) and convert them into a comprehensive technical exchange format (AC standard format, which can be further developed iteratively). This format serves to harmonise data sources from different data providers. The data from different data sources remain separate and are not mixed.
	
	6. AC publishes metadata of the data sources (e.g. import date, number of data records, location of data, format used) as well as information on the data provider (e.g. name of the institution that authorised the data provider). This serves to provide potential data users with information about the relevance of the data sources provided.

4. use of data sources

	1. If a user wishes to use one or more provided data sources in external applications ("data user"), he creates an entry for which application ("app") he wishes to use the data sources. The data user attaches a concrete description of the app to the entry, which enables the data provider to understand the purpose of the app.

	2. a secret key ("token") is used to authenticate apps and users when using data via the AC API. This token should be kept secret by the data user and may only be passed on to persons who act on behalf of the data user and are thus authorised to use the data accessible via the token. The token may change and has no guaranteed validity period.

	3. The data user may only use the data sources provided on AC in accordance with the rights of use specified in each case by the data provider. Furthermore, the use of the services provided by AC does not constitute a contractual relationship between the data provider and the data user. Users are free to conclude contracts with each other and independently of AC for the use of data provided via AC. It is the responsibility of the data provider to punish infringements of the rights of use to the data sources provided by him.

	4. The data user affirms that he will only retrieve data via the API to the extent that the operation of AC is not disturbed. If a data user wishes to query larger data volumes (more than 500 MB per day or more than 10000 queries per day), he must first obtain the Operator's consent by e-mail at support@accessibility.cloud If the data user requests larger amounts of data without the consent of the Operator, the Operator reserves the right to charge the costs incurred by the request and to take further measures in accordance with Section 7 of these Terms of Use.

	5. The operator has the role of a neutral intermediary with regard to the provision and use of data sources. The operator's role shall be limited to providing the technical infrastructure for the provision and use of the data sources.

5. accuracy and legality of data sources

	1. The operator, as a non-profit association, can neither check nor monitor the accuracy and timeliness of the data sources provided in the AC and does not do so. The operator therefore assumes no liability for the accuracy and timeliness of the data sources.

	2. Should a user discover that data sources are incorrect, he can inform the operator about the contact information stored on the operator's website that is in the source. If the reported data sources are recognizably incorrect, the operator will take suitable and appropriate measures to have the data sources corrected by the data provider. The operator himself does not correct the data sources. In case of dispute, the operator mediates between the data provider and the data user.

	3. if there are concrete indications (e.g. due to a claim/complaint by a third party) that the data contained in a data source are illegal or have been illegally transmitted to AC or otherwise infringe the rights of third parties, the Operator may deactivate the data source until the legality has been finally clarified. In this case, the data source will not be deleted, but made unavailable for all authorized apps. The operator reserves the right to take further measures against the data provider of the affected data source in accordance with Section 7 of these Terms of Use.


6. system integrity

	1. members may not use any mechanisms, software or other scripts in connection with the use of the AC or the website that may interfere with the functioning of the AC or the website.

	2. members may not take any measures that may result in an unreasonable or excessive load on the AC or the website.
  

7. administration and termination

	1. The Operator may take the following measures if there are concrete indications that statutory provisions, the rights of third parties or these Terms of Use are being violated or if the Operator has any other justified interest, in particular to protect the users of AC or to ensure the correctness and legality of the data sources:

		- Deactivation of data sources
		- Deletion of data sources and other content
		- Warning of users
		- Restricting the use of the AC
		- Temporary blocking
		- Final blocking

		When selecting a measure, the operator shall take into account the legitimate interests of the user concerned. The user will be informed about the measure taken via the e-mail address stored by him.

	2. For the duration of the blocking, a user may not use the AC with other user accounts and may not log on again.

	3. The Operator may terminate the user contract with the User at any time with 14 days' notice to the end of the month.

  

8. Liability

	1. The operator is liable according to the legal regulations for intent and gross negligence. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or other strict liability as well as claims under the Product Liability Act or culpable injury to life, limb or health. The Operator shall also be liable for damages caused by simple negligence if these were caused due to a violation of a duty which is decisive for the fulfilment of the services provided with AC and on which the User has relied and may rely; in this case, however, the Operator's liability shall be limited to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage.

	2. Further liability of the operator is excluded. In particular, the operator is not liable for the illegal use of data sources by the data user.

	3. As far as the liability of the operator is excluded or limited, this also applies in favour of the personal liability of his legal representatives, leading employees and simple vicarious agents.

9. exemption

	1. The data provider shall indemnify the operator against all claims asserted against the operator by other users or other third parties due to infringement of their rights in connection with the data sources provided by the data provider on the AC. The data provider shall bear the costs of the necessary legal defence of the operator, including all court and lawyer's fees in the statutory amount. This does not apply if the data provider is not responsible for the infringement. The data provider is obliged to make available to the operator immediately, truthfully and completely all information which is necessary for the examination of the claims and a defense in the case of a claim by third parties.

	2. The users of AC shall indemnify the operator, irrespective of their capacity as data provider or data user, against claims by third parties resulting from improper use of AC by the users. Section 9.1 shall apply accordingly in such cases. Improper use" includes any use of the AC that conflicts with these Terms of Use.

10. final provisions

	1. The operator has the right to change these terms of use at any time with effect for the future. The operator will inform the users of changed terms of use by e-mail to the stored addresses at least one month before they come into effect. If the user does not object to the new terms of use until they come into effect, the amended terms of use shall be deemed to have been agreed. The operator will expressly inform the user about his right of objection and the consequences of an objection not declared in due time when referring to the changed terms of use.

	2. The operator is entitled to transfer his rights and obligations from this contractual relationship in whole or in part to a third party with a notice period of four weeks.

	3. The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply exclusively to these Terms of Use.

	4. For users who are merchants within the meaning of the German Commercial Code, a special fund under public law or a legal entity under public law, the registered office of the Operator shall be the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from and in connection with these Terms of Use.

	5. For users who are consumers, the place of jurisdiction shall be the respective domicile of the user. For all disputes arising from and in connection with these Terms of Use, the registered office of the Operator is agreed as the additional place of jurisdiction.
